        <h1>About the owner and her philosophy</h1>

        Hi, my name is Amanda B Cormer and I'm the owner of ABC Opticals, and
        I'd like to briefly introduce you to who we are. I'm an optometrist with
        20 years’ experience, having worked for independents and chain stores
        both here and in London. It was in London that I gravitated to the
        groovy, high end of the market and returned to Brisbane 9 years ago with
        a new concept.

        Over years of working for others, what struck me was either mediocre
        eyewear, outdated testing equipment in the back room, or both. ABC
        Opticals brings together the world’s finest and funkiest eyewear
        designers, coupled with state of the art equipment to make the eye
        examination a very civilised affair.

        We enjoy selling quality products, and most importantly, we enjoy
        finding the right frame for the right person. That's what we do and we
        do it well. We don't sell eyewear over the net, so visit us in person.
        We're worth the effort and your eyes should be too. Finally, we believe
        that children should be treated as special people so all our staff will
        make the experience at ABC Opticals the best we can for your child.

        <h1>Features of the Website</h1>
        <p>
          A visually attractive site with that shows examples of your product
          but no shopping cart features are required, as yet.
        </p>
        <p>A generic contact form, that captures e-mail and a message</p>
        <p>A join/unsubscribe from e-mail newsletter feature.</p>
        <p>
          A book a consultation form that links to a free/busy calendar. This
          would allow our staff to use the website as a de facto diary, negating
          the need for paper…
